### HOTS Scores

HOTS scores is a companion app for Blizzard's MOBA, Heroes of the Storm.
It aims to help player with analyzing their matches for given period and show where they excelled.
Currently the app shows only general statistics but more detailed role stats are planned for adding.

HOTS Scores relays on HotS API (http://hotsapi.net/) backend for obtaining replays data, but support can be added for other replay apis (Blizzard's planned official HOTS API (still not released) or HOTS Logs))
